🩺 Real-Time Patient Queue Management System

A smart, digital, and real-time solution to eliminate long and unmanaged queues at hospitals, clinics, and any queue-based service centers.

⸻

📌 1. Problem Statement

Hospitals and clinics often face long, unmanaged queues causing:
	•	Patient discomfort & frustration
	•	Long wait hours with zero visibility of when their turn will come
	•	Overload on receptionists answering “Abhi kitna time lagega?”
	•	Crowding, chaos, and poor experience — especially for seniors, children, and patients traveling from far

A smarter, digital solution is needed to improve patient flow and experience.

💡 2. Brief Idea

A Real-Time Patient Queue Tracking System that removes the need for physical waiting.

Patients can register from anywhere using a mobile app, while doctors manage the queue using a web dashboard.

What the system provides:
	•	Live token updates
	•	User’s queue number
	•	Estimated wait time (ETA)
	•	Notifications when turn is near

Tech Stack:
	•	Backend: Django REST Framework
	•	Mobile App: React Native
	•	Doctor Dashboard: React.js
	•	Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite3
	•	Real-Time Updates: WebSockets / Push Notifications

It can also be used for walk-in interviews, clinics, salons, or government queues.
